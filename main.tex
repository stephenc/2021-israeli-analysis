\section*{Methods}

Datasets were processed using the R language \cite{RLanguage:2020} and the tidyverse packages \cite{Tidyverse:2019}.

\subsection*{Population demographics}

Israeli population demographics\cite{CbsGovIl:2021} were downloaded on 19/08/2021.
The headings in the spreadsheet were translated, age data was grouped into buckets to align with the common age buckets in the other data sets.

\subsection*{SARS-nCov-2 statistics}

Israeli SARS-nCoV-2 datasets\cite{DataGovIl:2021} were downloaded between 17/08/2021 and 19/09/2021.
For each dataset, the age groups were aggregated to align with the common set of age buckets: 0-19; 80+ and all intermediate buckets in 10 year divisions.
Some of the datasets include data points which have been range limited, for example \texttt{<5} indicates a non zero value of between 1 and 4 events.
Range limited data points have been handled by substitution of random integer values selected from the indicated range.
An alternative analysis using the midpoint of the range did not differ significantly.
